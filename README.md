# Visualizing the gender gap in college degrees
In this exercise I have visualized the gender gap in college degrees in one visualization to show the trend of gender gap in 
college degrees offered since 1970.I have grouped all the degrees in three categories, STEM , liberal arts and other categories.
The categories have following degrees:
 
**STEM** - ['Psychology', 'Biology', 'Math and Statistics', 'Physical Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering']

**Liberal arts** - ['Foreign Languages', 'English', 'Communications and Journalism', 'Art and Performance', 'Social Sciences and History']

**Other categories** - ['Health Professions', 'Public Administration', 'Education', 'Agriculture','Business', 'Architecture']

All three of these lists are ordered in descending order by the percentage of degrees awarded to women.

men and women. In psycology higher percent of graduates are women.
